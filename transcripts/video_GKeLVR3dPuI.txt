I know right I know another live stream another mentorship oh my goodness how you doing folks I hope you're doing
well give me a second here I apologize for being slightly late the OBS streaming service thing I here I used
wasn't cooperating with me so I couldn't find the settings to get myu to show up so I just make sure
JS like it looks like sure second one more time that's so I have it set to the lowest
latency so when I'm showing my 15sec chart we won't go down to a 15c chart to one all right so let me explain
doing as you know I've been trying to get my kids to want to do this pretty much since they were born trying to mold
them not thinking for the purposes of procuring an income from someone else's hand relying on them to say what
I don't like to cultivate an employee mentality because I don't have so recently had an interest in making
another attempt at doing this I know a lot of you always ask you know how are my kids doing um how they doing in their
in their learning and whatnot first of all I make them work and it's work hardening it will make you
it if you're forced to do it if you get money from Daddy and you get a lifestyle given to you it kind of makes makes you
lazy and become very L ofas and you just don't really have any pursuit in you so that method I've used has hopefully
done its work in venom of uh making him want to leave the the rat race knowing that I'm not just going to dull money
his interest is again Peak and want to make a good good attempt at it so I get a lot of questions about you
know if if you're teaching your kids you how do you teach your kids you know what is it that uh you do differently if you
differently and I I honestly I do I do things slightly differently because you know they're my kids okay you're not
entitled to anything from me I'm not I would do anything I'm not expected you to to be your best friend or to be your
your guiding like as much as I seem like I am in your videos it's because I'm talking to my kids and that's why you
have this you connection with you because you hear the sincerity in what it is I'm teaching because I care about
them receiving it from you so it's like a an archive of me teaching instructing encouraging my own children so when
empathy it's genuine because I have them in my mind now invariably sometimes I get a student that's outside my family
tree and they'll contact me and they'll say hey look you know I really appreciate that you could do this this
that and I would touch on those types of those typs about and or one of my kids will say Dad how do you how do you deal
with a situation like this or what if the market does that do you know when not to do something or when should you
um I'm going to talk a little bit about that not so much today but I want to give like a baseline on where you should
be at when you first sit down to start this I'll push buttons in front of you I'll talk about where the market should
go I'll talk about what PD array isn't so important to me at the time and why and the ones that I think important so
that way it kind of like filters Out and because I plan on doing this Monday Friday it will be a exercise for you now
if you are already profitable if you're already profitable whether you're using my Concepts or a derivative of them or
different it's probably better that you don't watch the live stream just do what you normally do because I'm probably
going to distract you or I'll be a perfect excuse for you if you take a losing trade you'll say ICT call me
to lose money and you won't take responsibility and you need to be responsible okay um the things I'm going
to touch on is obviously you know where your mind should be every day sitting down in front of the charts you
have to have some reason to be in the charts doing it so that's the reason why I started the The Stream at around 8 o'
I know it was like seven minutes late but you're not my employer so I can punch in late if I want and I can go
home early if I want so I want to talk a little bit about that ahead of 8:30 we have an a heavy
news driver the ism PMI number at 10 o'cl I'll be with you until probably like quarter after 10: okay but uh this
mentorship at least the first lecture here is probably going to be a little Annoying for some of you that just want
to get out here and start pushing buttons but I promise you if you don't want to sit through this Live come back
to it when you have time to do it before you watch tomorrow's live stream okay because otherwise you'll miss the whole
importance of what it is that you should be doing before you sit down whether you're watching my live stream someone
else's live stream or you're doing your own model you're in tre okay because it's very very important that you have a
real reason of why you're doing it some of you are here just want to see me do something and and it not pan out just so
we can go on social media and get some CPS and likes and some you interactions because you need to get your grocery
but I'm not here to do those types of things I'm not here to brag I'm not here to post and yes I'm going to win the
robins cup to stop sending me emails okay just I got plenty of time for that don't worry about it it's in the bag
trust me on that I told you all I would give you a drama i' would give you a tragedy I give you a tear jerker but at
the end of the year it's my name at the top of that list okay so just just just relax keep making your videos because
you look stupid expose ICT filed Robin's Cup this going to make it even better but anyway our focus is going to be
primarily on the NASDAQ today but in this mentorship I will go back to talking about Forex because I know a lot
of you are stuck in that asset class okay even though I'm not interested in pushing any orders through that market
anymore I will cover some of the things that are Salient to that individual asset class when it is appropriate but
it's not appropriate right now because right now I want you to think about what it is you should doing before you are
trying to trade before you're trying to trade with your funded accounts or trying to pass combines or whatnot um
full disclosure I talked to Caleb and I asked him you what his intentions were what he wants to do what he's willing to
do U he wants to share and document his progress so he'll be doing a a YouTube channel so when I teach um I'm talking
he's not with me right now but he's listening and watching you are so the things I'm talking about in this is
be my suggestion to you if you maybe you've watched some of my videos maybe you watched a lot of my videos and you
just don't know what to do or where to begin or what to do right now what do I do right now because it's very daunting
seeing how many videos I have and all these different concepts and all these different things these moving Parts it's
intimidating and I get it but it's it's meant to be a compendium meaning it's like it's my entire Encyclopedia of what
I'm willing to give to the public so you can go and you can build your own model so I'm going to show my son how he
should do it correctly this time where it's step by step dad's going to be explaining it live so that way there's
no hindsight stuff not that it was ever hindsight when I was teaching and he would watch me push the button right in
front of him he would see me explain I think it's going to go here this is where it's going to go next I don't want
to see it do this I don't want to do that this is real mentorship okay it's we're not going to be doing any Market
replay we're going to talk about Theory and say now let me push the market forward and watch what happens when you
had the benefit of already knowing what it's going to do that is absolutely not that's not mentorship that is absolutely
not teaching anybody anything and it certainly doesn't Inspire trust in the person that you're learning from because
they have the added benefit of knowing so seeing live price action watching data ticked without the benefit of
knowing what it's going to do is exactly what you as a Trader are going to have to encounter every single time you sit
in front of the charts you don't know what's going to happen and right now is a wonderful learning experience because
the climate is so statically charged everything that's going on over the Middle East right now they're going to
entire Market globally and probably in your the woods where you live so it increases the level of
responsibility on your part as someone that wants to engage in these markets because they're very risky and now add
to it the increased level and amplitude of uncertainty where anything can happen you know a bomb drops or series
of bombs drop in an unexpected location and then boom everything starts changing rapidly and
that fear and that Rush will be injected marketplace and they will use they being the people that are in charge of price
action it's not the buying and selling pressure that moves price and you'll hear a lot about that as I go and I know
some of you don't like that I know some of you don't believe in an algorithm I know you believe that you know buyers
and sellers push price and that's fine I'll leave you to that myth you want to believe in fairy tales that's your
that's your business I'm not going to try to wake you up from your dream sleep tight price will do what it's going to
do because it's coded to do it based on time okay and time is essential it's the first Hallmark to when and why a market
should produce a displacement a run whether it be impulsive whether it be anything it's always going to be
delivered on the basis of time it's at a specific time or a period of time within 20 minutes that's a macro
and we're going to talk about those things because I want to simplify it for my son you all are getting that benefit
of seeing it hearing it and being explained to you as if it were you being Caleb I'm not hiding anything I just
sent him a text before I started I said just stop texting me I'm doing it live right now don't talk to me in the text
because you're going to distract me okay so there's no secret texting going on there's no conversation behind the
scenes everything you see and experience while I'm doing these live streams is exactly what he's digesting the same way
and the things that I'm going to encourage him to do my suggestion is to try it for yourself and you're going to
see everything that I taught is complicated the complication comes from people that want to take my stuff they
want to water it down to a one two3 a pattern so they can go out to Amazon and write a book there's dozens of books
about in them and I'm quite certain all of them are wrong but it's a cash grab because my name's big right
now it won't be forever and somebody else will become something interesting and and and that'll be the new Buzz
now the problem with it the community that has any interest in me is either they want to do the gacha about me
because it gives them grocery m or they want to learn from me and then say they don't learn from me but they
talk with my vernacular they use all my terms they tra just like me but they say they don't and they do
so if you're one of those individuals I'm going to help you too not because I want to but because it's going to be a
default it's it's going to be a default uh response to you being here because you're going to learn how to finally do
it instead of attending instead of talking about and teaching through um I asked my son what his interest was
he doesn't want me to give him money to trade with which is good that's cool so I asked him what his intentions were and
he said are you going to go through like a Prof again and he said he was going to use TOP Step now for
disclosure uh if anyone if anyone from Top step is listening I don't know if they do or don't I know I have students
in my mentorship that are affiliated with them um directly not just users of it but they have no connection to me
they have no connection to my son Caleb there is no affiliate links okay I have no connection with TOP Step I did not
ask them to be a partner with me I they didn't ask me to be a partner with them I'm not trying to push any of you to
their company I personally would not TR with with the company like any of them I I just I I personally wouldn't do it I'm
just stating full disclosure while my son learns how to do this when he feels again he will then use top step to do a
uh a funded account so that way everything could be seen through the lens of that instrument so you can see
what he's doing when he's making money when he's not making money if he does any withdrawals and gets payouts you'll
see all that stuff okay so it's kind of like a a test tube baby experiment he's completely he says he is we'll see what
happens when we do a little further along but he says he's comfortable with disclosing all of it and he wants to put
it on his own YouTube channel and why does he want to do that because I'm GNA I'm want to kill that real quick I know
a lot of you are psted up and your paintings are on a bunch oh if he's so good and he's your son he shouldn't need
to do all these things well here's what he's doing he's working a job just like you are you're working a job but you're
probably on other people's YouTube channels and you're trolling people and you're on those social media trolling
because you're miserable because you don't have any money dad's not giving him any money he doesn't want Dad to
give him money he wants to do it on his own stee I respect that that's exactly what I want him to do I want all my kids
to do that I gave money to Cody and it didn't help him so I learned my lesson there so I make my kids
work if he knows there is an interest and there's a huge interest in what my kids are learning from me
directly so if I'm willing to teach him that and he's willing to share that and I'm comfortable with that because if he
makes a YouTube channel while he's learning yes there will be ad Revenue behind those videos that he puts up and
shows his his progress that's not important right now in the grand scheme of things because there isn't going to
be a whole lot of viewership I'm sure initially there's going to be the morbid curios of seeing him fail when he does
fail and they will be celebrated amongst the social media networks okay that's great that's that's that's good because
that draws a crowd but when he has his Milestones where he grows and gets a little bit more understanding and he
finds his successes and you hear him explain what he struggles with when you hear him explain what he felt Victorious
over and what he made a big deal out of while he was first learning how to do it and then he realizes it wasn't that big
personify the very things that I've already taught and mentioned in Twitter spaces where I would marless Council
encourage them but you think I'm talking to you I'm talking to them and it feels like we you and I have a intimate
relationship that I care about you on a personal level because I'm speaking that them so you can tap into that same work
and or Hive mentality that I have directed towards my own children by mentorship it will be over life price
be real experience that way you can see what it is that you should be doing and try at my best try to steer you away
from the things that you're probably going to want to be doing but they're going to be detrimental to your
development and this first lecture is number one your mindset going into and then how we set up our starts what we're
looking for to start a baseline to determine what type of Trader you're going to be because it's real important
that I don't push you into a mode Caleb needs to tell me what he wants to do and then once he finds out what that is and
I'm going to teach how to determine what that is for yourself today too because if you don't have that direction if you
don't have that pathway you're going to waste a lot of time you're going to chase things you're going to worry about
things that are not important it's going to actually slow your growth it'll slow down your productivity and it'll hold
you back and there's nothing more challenging than feeling like you're not doing enough in trading because no
matter if you're making money or not you know what it's like if you've made any money whether it be a demo account you
dabbling around with it or you tried to fund it accounts and you got lucky you got a pay out and then now you never can
changed nothing changed you just got lucky doing something that had no bearing on what you should be doing
consistently going forward it was just an aition it's something that you it happened but now you have attributed to
well that's that's that's skill and we're going to show how you develop real skill so that way you can produce a
consistent Baseline to to evaluate okay do I want to be a Trader that focuses on long-term Trend
and only trading in that direction or do I look for periods where even in those movements where can I see potential
retracements because I understand the trend may be going in One Direction but it's something I don't trust to be be a
part of because maybe you've tried entering on Trend models and they burn you and they retrace deeply against you
more comfortable fading those types of moves I'm going to teach on that topic as well so that way you'll have reversal
patterns Turtle suit real Turtle suit not Twitter wish versions of it the idea of knowing where the market should
deeper maybe even the basis of retracing to set up a long-term Trend model entry to get in sync with that daily and or
weekly Direction so it's a it's real important that you have some input initially not just take everything I'm
saying writing it down in your notes and saying okay I'm going to do this this this this this and I'm going to file to
the letter of the law and then it's going to give me what I'm looking for there we're in that gray area initially
where you have the responsibility because if you don't do this part correctly everything you do after this
holds you up and it's not because my stuff doesn't work doesn't mean that I'm not a good teacher doesn't mean that
that you can't consistently profitable it just means that you screwed up and didn't listen to this first lesson you
determine what you're going to do as a Trader and then whatever that is you bloom there you plant yourself in that
you don't care what Caleb does you don't care what I do you don't care what every one of my other students do that live
stream and do it right in front of you you don't care what anybody else is doing even outside of my circle of
influence whatever they're doing whether they're being profitable not that's none of your business you're going to have no
bearing on their outcome or their results you're not going to make them more money you're not going to prevent
them from being profitable so why waste any time trying to do that don't try to copy cut anybody don't try to do that
the things that you should try to copy is the mindset about what I'm going to cover in terms of reading price very
specific generic things that are absolutely not complicated folks it is complication comes when people want to
try to dilute it to make it look like it really isn't my Concepts or my teachings lectures that's what makes it
complicated that's why everybody asks for my slides from the mentorship that's why everybody says talk little you talk
too much because most of them are not English speaking individuals and they want to translate it into their local
language and if you are running a YouTube channel I'm going to toss this in real quick if you're doing a YouTube
channel and there's a dozen of you right now that I'm getting R into copyright strikes against you're translating all
of my mentorship videos into your local language and I don't give you permission to do that I've already taken down
several channels that have done that and you can be mad at me you can send me hate mail you can do all those things
and be mad at me about that but I've already said that I don't give you permission to do that you know if if you
want to do that go write a book on Amazon that's what people have done okay I can't stop you from doing that and
everybody wants apparently wants to buy them so go ahead and go that but you don't have my permission to take the the
work the time and effort I put into making charts the lectures the graphics all those things I did that on my own
you don't have you don't have the rights to use them so uh you're all going to lose your app Revenue in that and I
don't feel bad for you because I already wanted you ahead of time so no you don't have the permission to do that but Caleb
will have whatever he gets in terms of AD Revenue to help meet his bills while he works his job and it helps alleviate
some of those things that plague people while they're trying to learn which is I need to make money real fast because you
can't force being profitable you can't do it folks you absolutely cannot do it and I said this in my mentorship to my
students I said listen one of the best things you can do is create another stream of income and I gave them
permission that hey look if you want to go out and live stream not teach that was when I was doing the mentorship
go out and and show on a live stream and monetize it that your development is here here's what I'm trying to do I'm
trying to be profitable and I'm going to trade the Forex Market or I'm going to trade you know futures or whatever is
you know some of them trade crypto I don't like crypto but it is what it is the uh by the way did you hear about
crypto or Trump came out and said he was going to make America like the the hubs for Bitcoin all of a sudden Bitcoin fell
out of bed that's interesting isn't it but anyway I encourage my students to live stream to get a
secondary income because that passive secondary income can be a way of maneuvering the fear and anxiety away
from you needing to be perfect in your toxic absolutely toxic you cannot have that mindset as a Trader you can't do
that you have to invite the opportunity for you to be wrong and then it doesn't counterintuitive to say okay I invite
myself to be incorrect about what my assumptions are about the price action right now and when I go into a trade
when you go into a trade as soon as you enter that trade you've completely given responsibility of the outcome to the
you don't have any assurity that your stock loss is going to get you out at that price you don't have that
promise that guarantee the market could happen especially in the conditions we have right now where a bomb a war can
break out in an undisclosed location boom unexpected events bang you have a huge gap and it could Gap Way Beyond
where your stop loss is and guess what folks that risk is always there that's why every brokerage firm makes you sign
these risk disclosures because that's what can happen and when it happens you want to sue The Brokerage company you
want to sue this one and Sue that one because the unexpected happen and for individuals that trade with extreme
leverage that would never do that with a real account but they were doing it with their funded account because all they
got to do is pay the reset or they get free free resets because they having an affiliate program with one of these
companies it kind of promotes the wrong wrong idea okay it doesn't matter how many times you can show that you did
here but it you're constantly restarting these new accounts you if you're an influencer and you keep doing that
you're actually having a detrimental impact on your viewership because selective vision and selective hearing
they're attracted to when it's right and when it makes money so therefore I want to be like this person because look what
they just made but you're not disclosing the entirety behind everything and I just blew 25 accounts or I just had to
reset 16 accounts because every one of out it kind of It kind of defeats the whole premise behind what is it you're
doing following them except for just entertainment value so I'm trying not to be um anything but straight nuts and
bolts this is what you're supposed to be focusing on but if I don't lay the groundw work initially on the first
discussion here in the first 20 minutes so you won't know what we're doing and you'll just be watching for something
and anticipating or trying to predict what it is I'm going to say next and that's not going to be helpful to you in
fact it'll probably be very frustrating for you and you'll either turn off and go watch the The Usual Suspects on on my
uh live streaming or you'll just walk away and you'll do nothing with it and maybe you'll come back to this live
stream at a later time but you'll still have this better bitter taste in your mouth and you won't be willing to write
down the things I'm talking about and preparing yourself you have to absolutely prepare yourself to learn
properly and if you don't have that mindset going in everything you do everything you focus on will be the
things they they'll all be doing things are you know moving towards um that's the number one goal whether it be
learning from me or learning from anyone not aach that is outside your grasp right now it might be because you're
new but if you do the things that I'm going to suggest to my son and he doesn't Rush he doesn't rush
to go and try to pass a combine he doesn't rush to get a payout he doesn't try to trade every single fluctuation in
price he doesn't try to do everything that I've made available to all of you which is what most of my students try to
do they all dabble too much and if you simply go through this simple question and answer for yourself
right now are you someone now if you're not paying attention right now you're distracted you're going to miss
it but the type of person you are right now are you someone if someone says to you uh I don't think this is possible
and it doesn't necessarily be trading I don't think this is possible or I don't think that you can do that are you
someone that says they're probably or I'm going to show this person they're wrong and I'm going to show them 12 ways
that why they're wrong and I'm going to do beyond what they thought I said I was going to do or I could do and they said
I couldn't do I'm going to do more than that okay because right now we're going to divide you all as an audience because
either you're going to be someone that's influenced and held back by someone else's opinion or suggestion on you or
maybe you've watched someone else criticism okay you've watched other people receive criticism and then you
somehow latch on to that like it was told to you and you feel emotional about it and you have a
psychological response and it was never directed to you but you personify it and telling that is a barrier for you as a
Trader you may not realize it right now but Friday I'm going to cover the contrasts of all that you may not know
the answers to these things right now today because you want to think about what I'm going to tell you and you all
want to be able to say yeah I want to be the guy or gal that says if you can't do this I'm going to prove it to them and
I'm going to do this and do that chances are every male list is probably going to be wanting to do that but in you in
honesty all of you aren't really like that you're influenced by other people's opinion and it makes you feel unsure
about yourself it may be causing anxiety it may feel embarrassment you may feel like you don't feel you're going to do
well because of someone else's opinion or you have that spark that inspiration that well kicking the uh the hinder
Parts if you will to to now do something because it's a challenge that's been laid in your hands like now this is what
it's like for for me when I listen to other people when they say this can't be done or no one can do that I am the
person my personality is is you tell me that that can't be done or that I can't do something I immediately my mind
immediately switches on I'm in Predator mode like I'm in there looking for every way to come back at them and say this is
how you're wrong and you were wrong here and you were wrong here and you were wrong there and you were wrong there
everywhere and I want to bury them in it that's my mentality and that's not a strength that's just how I interact with
influences and that stems from a childhood that I had no control over the factors and environments that I was left
in which were dangerous and they were hostile so as an adult now I seek control all the time I am a control
freak everything in every aspect of my life I have to have control over it if I don't have any control over it I am I
have no interest in it that's my pre that's my disposition that's that's how am you may not be that way you may be
very very passive and you may be very lethargic in terms of responding to things that are met as a challenge
towards you and you may be using that very perception about the marketplace and that's your hindrance that's the
barrier that you have to if you have that mentality you're going to have to break through that and it's not going to
be easy for you because what you're is most people fail doing this most people are not consistent most people
can't even determine where the Mark's going to go let alone get in stopped out or man it's risk appropriate
that's the majority that's the truth about this industry very very very few consistently and you know this but
you're still willing to watch videos you're still willing to try to practice and and Dabble because you're waiting
for some kind of magical thing occur where it just it clicks for you with no real effort with no real study with no
real blogging and journaling you think it's going to happen for you that's not realistic so part of this mentorship
the the tools and resources of journaling properly but what is it you're supposed to be journaling anyway
because if you're if you don't know what you're doing you don't know where the Market's going to go next because you
don't know bias you don't know profiling you don't know session characteristics All Those things I'm going to present it
in a nice neat little package but it cannot be done in one video I don't I don't care how many people go on YouTube
and try to say I watched all of ict's videos and now I'm G to show you in five minutes how you can do it you want to do
that I promise you okay here it is $500,000 okay go out there you don't know what you're doing right now go out
there and watch the one of the five minute trainer YouTubers okay and you got four weeks to pass a combine and
make $100,000 by the end of the year if you can prove that I will give you $500,000 I will drive to your location
as long as you're in in the states I will drive because I don't fly I'll drive to your place and you can live
stream me live stream me giving you a $500,000 Bank check okay that stuff doesn't work folks you're going to have
to put some real effort into it you can't condense it you can't reduce it down okay and a lot of people don't
realize but you what I just did I just made a lot of those guys mad and now they're going to really do the little
micro mentorships and really what that does is going to bring more traction back to this mentorship because they're
going to work for free but anyway see monical he's a masteron he's anyway the very first step is for you to
determine where you are mentally and then determine ahead of time preparing yourself what adversities are going to
be in front of you for the folks that are saying okay you say I can't do this this or someone else is saying that you
can't do this you're going to go at at net that's that's good that you have confidence in yourself but the problem
is you're going to overstep that and become overconfident and then as soon as you're met with that first
adversity it's going to really hold you down and it's going to cause you to second guess the next step of stepping
out there in faith in determining what it is that you're trying to do or practicing and then what you end up
doing is the initial strength is I'm strong I'm confident and nobody's going to tell me I can't do it I'm going to do
it better than I would have done it if they would just invited me to do it casually but now because he said I
couldn't do it I'm GNA do a superhuman Olympic feat of it and by doing that what you end up doing is you increase
the level of adversity the difficulty you put a time limit on it which is the worst thing in the world to do you
absolutely put a a time limit on how fast you should learn how to do something as soon as someone starts
telling you I'm going to teach you how to do ICT or anything else in this number of days absolutely I promise you
they are full of grade a manure they're lying to you that's clicks for money they want you to either
buy something they're going to upsell to you later on or they want you to keep watching their videos that are not going
to help you they may be entertaining but they're not going to supercharge your understanding they're not going to make
you faster at learning it okay the only thing they're doing is trying to capitalize on a market that's huge right
now which is Tik Tock mentality you know 10c 15c 30 second uh time span of attention span and I I have no patience
for anyone zero patience for anyone as a student that thinks like that I broom them quickly I get them out of my face I
don't want to have any interaction with them because you're absolutely lazy you're absolutely lazy you want it easy
you want it real fast and you have unrealistic expectations and anyone that Hason sense will tell you that that is
someone that will not be successful period and the story if you don't want to warm up the idea to how how to do
understand really understand that's what mentorship is understanding how you're going to most likely in interact with
the marketplace what's a reasonable response to you for you feeling this way or that way should the market produce an
outcome that was either favorable or not favorable for you how are you going interact with let's say the first time
you sit down and you try to test something and it takes off and runs like 150 Handles in the nasda
that what's that going to feel like for you you're going to feel ecstatic you're going to be excited and you're going to
feel like wow this is a whole lot easier than I thought and that's wrong but see that's the problem with
these 20 year olds that teach they want you to have the emotional stimuli because that emotional stimuli gives you
rush it's dopamine it's it gives you that physical Feelgood butterfly moment last it will not last 10 minutes later
you're not buzzing by that right call that you made that demo trade that you made or that just past your combine you
all think that I got to get my combine passed and then I can start trading an account where I can make profitable
trades so you're will to do everything and anything just to gamble to get it past and then once you get there you
think it's going to be easy when it becomes extremely much more difficult because now you don't want to lose that
account and every Candlestick looks like a foreign language to you even if you understand certain elements of reading
price action it will look completely different you won't feel comfortable pushing a button because now you're
thinking if I get in right here what if it goes down to here or what if it goes this to this High here where do I put my
stop loss I don't want to get stopped out but I gota use a stop and see what are you doing you're trying to protect
yourself from a losing trade because that losing trade even if it's small in denomination if it's small in amount of
risk the lasting impact in the depths of how far it digs into your backside it's monstrous because you're
creating a demon you're manifesting your worst adversary because you didn't do everything that I'm suggesting as a
starting point right now It prepares you for this what do you think basic training is for when people go to the
military it's to get the person physically fit get them introduced to constant mental fatigue so that way
they're not shell shocked and they get out on the battlefield and freeze up they're used to being treated like trash
fatigued run them work them hard talk down to them there's no hope there's no hope while you're in basic training well
this is what this is like here this is basic training I'm not going to sugar coat it for you Millennials I'm not
going to be nice to you and say honey it's going to be okay let me hold you let me hold you close and cuddle you
ict's got you baby ict's got you it's okay it's okay that's not what this is you want to learn how to trade you want
to be consistently profitable ICT is not going to be rubbing your shoulders for you okay and powdering your ass when the
Market's in front of you and you're ready to take a trade and it's all on you I'm not going to be there you have
to be able to do this on your own you have to be able to do this absolutely isolated you have to be an
island unto yourself when everybody else is on social media saying they want to do one thing or the other and you look
at your model saying I don't see that you got to be completely comfortable with that not for the basis of Simply
alone but for the basis of okay I understand what I'm looking for and this is just further confirmation that the
herd of sheep out there are expecting this so I know I have a lead pipe sense trade now because every time Dick and
Harry out there is wanting the market to go to this level or this direction and here I am sitting confidently
waiting for a setup that's completely diametrically opposed to what they expect that's one of the things that I
take great comfort in watching live because sometimes they get it right that's fine most of the time they aren't
and the times that I'm looking for something before I even start looking at their live stream if it's opposed to
what I'm expecting it's a dead deal it's over I know I'm I know I'm I'm on I'm over the target I know I'm right and
that's not the goal here but I know I'm going to use the maximum leverage okay so whatever my maximum leverage would be
for that individual asset class or that market I would be comfortable doing that but initially when you first want to do
this you want to be trading listen folks I know this is going to be unpopular but you want to be trading with a
micro just because that funded account says I can trade five contracts of the $3,000 of a cushion I want you to hear
this okay and I mean this sincerely and I'm not trying to be funny about it but if you're trading more than one
contract of a micro with 3,000 cushion and you're not consistent in cwow and you don't know what you're
doing you're absolutely gambling and you can gamble there's a lot of people over the years with all these fund of
account companies I've had students that's done this too paid mentorship students that have gone through it they
passed combines they got paid out and then they lost it and then it completely undid them and they can't get it back
and they can't he can't pass another combine why what what happened did the concept stop working did they change the
algorithm no now they have baggage they have scar tissue and now the lessons I taught in those Twitter spaces over the
last couple years and now I'm not on Twitter the the depths of where I was trying to take you a lot of you haven't
gone to those places yet in your trading so the lessons just went rid of your head it doesn't apply to me but for
anyone that has actually tried to trade with real money or had a live account or a funded account and has taken
and then they lost it now those Twitter spaces now those talking points those lectures like we're doing right here
they are much more meaningful and they're impactful and they are helpful but when you have a millennial
that wants to go out here and say look man this guy's full of crap you know he's he's he's talking too much he ain't
done anything he ain't pushing any buttons how am I gonna learn from somebody like that I need somebody going
show me what to do so I can copy them that's me learning no that's not you learning that's how you grow codependent
and I don't want any of you to be codependent I want you to be able to walk out there and say this is what I
see potentially unfolding in the marketplace today so I'm going to build an idea on how the market May in fact
set this up and if I understand that this is where it's likely to go now what I mean by that is where's the draw and
liquidity where's the market likely to go you know what are we looking for in terms of potential expectations and
where the market could trade to and that could be something like this we go to we have relative equal highs right
smooth price level the Market's gone lot several thousand handles okay we had a huge gap new week opening Gap here so
where we settled on Friday and where we opened on Sunday at six o'clock last night Eastern Time in the states that
new week opening Gap that's a draw on liquidity but we don't need it to trade all the way up to there so where is the
lwh hanging fruit objectives for just bias this is what I'm teaching you Caleb initially I want you to think about
where the market could draw to right now where it could go to next and what that does is it gives you
something to focus on and it also gives formation and what your expectation is as it's forming and what the next
candles should do and how they behave and what it feels like for you when you because whether you want to admit it or
starting the majority of your time is going to be spent in uncertainty in times of confusion it's
be well it's going to feel anxious you you'll feel anxious you may even start feeling body symptoms of
you're going to get sick and you may still only be in a demo because what you're doing is you're elevating the
outcome to a level that is not expected you don't need to put that much pressure on you in fact if
that's how you're thinking it's normal for you to feel that when you first start trading with a real account that's
a normal thing but there's no way around it there's no way around that first trade with real money that fear that
anxiety is something you just have to you have to engage it and that's why I say soon as you get a live count first
thing you should do is flip a quarter lowest leverage if it's tails you buy it if it's heads you sell short or vice
versa you do the smallest and put a 15 Point stop on it and just let it happen to you and get it break the ice and Let
It Go but see a lot of you if not all of you you you want your first trade to be a winner because you think it's a a jinx
okay it's somehow a an invitation for failure if your first trade with your real account loses money like that
somehow defines your entire career it transaction but the way you overcome that is spending time without pushing a
button studying where price can go and have the short term High here post 830 830 right here we have 836 so the market
went below these relative equal lows so any liquidity below that they disrupted that and then took it above this
short-term High took it above this short-term high and traded right inside this car value got right there
so when you're watching price Caleb you're looking for how the market trades in books between obvious price
levels with old highs old inefficiencies there are the only two things you're worried about you're not
trying to predict a direction on the day you're not trying to be right about 50 handle runs you're just studying
okay this down Clos candle here after taking out the liquidity and then we have displacement here displacement is
where the market runs against a pre session pre day pre Trend or Price it's a counter move to what's already
been in play so the market has dropped here and then we moved aggressively above the short-term high this High
being traded above there we go back down to this down closed candle that down Clos candle is a order block we have
displacement it took liquidity and the market has been one directional now what makes that order block specifically is
it is has happened post 8:30 now it could have formed right at 8:30 because 8:30 the algorithm will start
spooling for liquidity or inefficiencies one or the other now in the beginning you're going to want to know you're
probably asking right now can you just tell us what is it going to reach for is it going to go for an old high or old
low or is it going to go for a fair both it's going to go for both does that complicate it no now to
further strip away the you're adding to it right now you're bringing all these things but what if the co I didn't say
coot yeah but what happens if the did I say anything about those things that you're thinking right now no they're not
important the only thing we're doing is we're sitting down at a time a time when the market is
predisposed that means it's most likely going to do this and it will do it event where manual intervention steps in
and you don't know and I don't know when that's going to happen what does it look like when the market just starts
going and it starts going One Direction stop it doesn't go up a little bit come back a little bit up a little bit come
back a littleit that's that's market delivery intervention is Think Like payroll where if you're wrong if you're
offside right when it hits the market dead that's what manual intervention looks like there are many
times untradeable it it takes off so reasonably no not reasonable you're you're it's unreasonable for you to
assume that you can trade that once it starts because you're literally chasing the wind and you're never going to catch
it you're just going to frustrate yourself and get placed very poorly and you're going to be in a trade that's
going to be highly anxious and stressful and that's not trading that's gambling okay so when we look at individuals sit
up setups like this you want to sit down in front of the marketplace right before preferably 8:00 and you want to look at
where the highs and the lows are in in Defence to the one minute chart in a 15minute time so I'm G change this chart
over to 15 so here's what 15 minute here and if you look at where we came from see this high at 7 o'clock in the
morning that's this high right there see it on the right chart so this chart this larger chart here is the one minute and
this is the 15 minute time 15 five one minute those are your first three time frames to worry about okay I
shouldn't say worried because it's kind of us subconscious concern that you need to worry about it you don't need to
worry about it but the levels and inefficiencies on the 15 minute time frame the five minute time frame and the
one minute time frame if you're brand new you don't know how to trade ICT you don't have to trade price action you
don't have to trade period okay you don't need any other time frame okay you don't need anything else you don't need
a daily chart you don't need an hourly chart you don't need a 31 minute chart you don't need a 17 minute chart you
don't need a 15c chart you don't need anything below a one minute chart you don't need anything else to do what I'm
going to teach you okay this is what you're doing you're studying price at specific times of the day if you're not
writing this part down you're blowing it already so between 8:00 and 8:30 in the morning New York local time or Eastern
US everything I mentioned in terms of time that matches New York local time so set a clock if you have your smartphone
there's a way that you can pull up world time and put one in there for New York and you'll always know what time ICT is
saying to look for these things to happen because they're never going to there write that down again okay and
underline it this is always absolutely without fail it's never not going to do it it's always every single effing day
it's going to do this very thing it's going to do it it's going to absolutely do it because there is an algorithm and
it does this to spur on emotional interest or tangible orders that are actually sitting out there real orders
that are sitting above and below or inside of inefficiencies where the market needs to offer fair value to the
marketplace so what is it reaching for it's reaching for old highs old lows and inefficiencies that's the fair value Gap
C VY that thing so once we know that the market is likely to do these things that's a characteristic it's an
need anything else besides this element as the Foundation to what you're trade and you can make all the money
want I'm going to say that again in case you missed it you're trying to find right now you want the daily bias and
you want to be able to buy below the open and hold for the whole entire day but are you really doing those things
when you try to trade no as soon as you get 10 handles or 10 Pips or whatever you you start struggling with holding on
trade you're paranoid that that winning trade you just found out just fell into your lap oh my goodness this I'm winning
this this is something new I need to secure this but then you're you're thinking oh wait a minute I'm suppos be
holding for the daily range and now you're wrestling and that becomes a real hard wrestling match doesn't it makes
you feel nauseous and if anybody tries to talk to you even if they love you your spouse your girlfriend your
boyfriend your child your dog comes over nuzzles up next to you any other time you're like oh this time get away from
can't you see I'm trying to worry about move the weight of the world is on my shoulders right now and you're coming at
this you know what it means you're stressing out why why would you have response folks listening to headphones
like oh man this guy you're awake now you but that's the reality that's what it's like and you'll feel it if you
never been there you'll feel it but the reason why you feel that is because you don't know what you're
doing you haven't done this part long desensitized to okay I'm doing this exercise to get comfortable with
anticipating price moves I'm getting comfortable with not knowing what it's going to do next candle this candle five
candles from now but I think it's going to draw to specific price levels so if it clears that shortterm
low we talked about what's it going to reach into we have this inefficiency here how long does it take to do that
and then you record you screenshot this and you say okay well it took one two imbalance to run above this short ter
high and get into this C which is a sell side and balance bu side efficiency a fair value gut that has a down close is
a Civ okay a fair value Gap that has a close is a bissy b c efficiency so what you're doing is you're measuring because
you have zero Baseline experience you have no continuity and what is you're reaching for looking for in price action
and you study how long it took and you record that many this many minutes and you also are honestly going to record in
your Journal within the screenshot like like maybe over here or somewhere over here you're going to record what it felt
physically were you anxious did you second guess that it was going to run there did you feel excited the entire
time were you impatient that you thought it should have moved there sooner and faster did certain candle formations
cause you to you doubt it did you have a point at which you thought that this was given another opportunity to trade
to or not trade to but offer another entry like say for instance if you want to Pyramid pyramiding should not be part
of your repertoire yet that's something that you need to be doing maybe a year after trading with one contract oh come
on you want to learn how to do it correctly this is the way you do it there's all kinds of time and
opportunity for pyramided trades but you first have to get good at trading with contract one micro contract because what
that does is it removes hopefully this is the only thing you can do to to fend off the greed and
fear you can't blow the account if you micro and you only take one trade a day you there it's physically impossible
for you to go out there on day one and see that's what your your subconscious is fearful of I don't want to blow the
account I don't want to have a big losing trade I don't want to go into big draw down okay that's easy don't over
leverage your account and don't take more than one trade a day but ICT but ICT nothing if you want to be able to do
correctly you have to do things with a process there has to be a logic behind it there has to be some measure of rule
based thinking and then you have to adhere to that if you don't want to adhere to rules I promise you you're
going to lose you're going to fail and you're going to blame me you're going to blame everybody else you're going to
blame the the prop firm you're going to blame the brokerage firm you're going to you I knew this because I did the same
thing as a 20-year-old I did the same thing numerous times I have students that repeat the same thing
they've sent me hate mail years ago oh you you didn't teach me right this blah blah blah and then later on they went
through it properly and then they send me emails apologizing it was it was a mistake on my part ICT I didn't listen I
went back and relistened to it all and I made all the mistakes you said I was going to make if I didn't listen and
just plunged ahead and did what I wanted to do now I did it the right way I listened to what you were expecting in
of a properly mindset student that follows the rules and accepts the the paints but see you're trying to be the
ex exception you don't want it to happen to you you think it's going to be candy bars and milkshakes and just everything
sweet and lovely and butterflies are going to come land on your hand and no no no no no
no as soon as you push the button you're asking the shark to take a leg off you're asking that lion to take your
face off you're inviting it that's what it is as soon as you enter these markets you've entered the jungle
Waters and honey everybody's hungry and if you offer it up on a silver platter they're going to take it and eat it and
you can't be upset about it that's the that's the that's the the the currency here yours or mine mine or
yours that's it it doesn't matter how anybody else trades it's are you now are you liquidity because if you're
lunch I go in and I'm looking for lunch I'm looking for the liquidity I'm looking for reasons why the market will
trade to this level why it could potentially trade to this level but I don't need it to trade for
instance this is the draw on liquidity draw on liquidity is just a initial reasonable assumption on our
part to determine a directional move that could unfold it does not mean and it does not define the absolute
terminous to a price Run for the be all terms the Market's probably going to keep moving until it gets to this level
it doesn't mean that it can't have retracements lower it doesn't mean that it can't make a lower low than it's done
here highly unlikely but it's still a initial idea so when you're first trying to learn how to read these markets and
you're first trying to determine where the Market's likely to go you have to strip away everything that you're trying
to force into reading every single Candlestick and if you watch a lot of my videos or if you have a lot of notes or
you've dabbled in things chances are you probably already have a pet technique that you want to be yours and you may
not even be good at using it yet but you just want it because it has a cool name like a a Reaper fair value de you know I
talk that to my PR mentorship they're like uh oh man that's GNA be my thing that's gonna that's gonna be it for me
you know or Event Horizon which is the midpoint between two uh two new week opening gaps or New Day opening gaps and
okay these names are meaningful to me they're they're not meant to inspire you to want to do them over another it's
just that's that's what I name I got 81 of these things so it's a way for me to keep track of what its purpose was and
or it kind of puts a little stamp of when I discovered it and something had a impact on me and it was a cool name or
so when we're looking at price is you as a brand new student not knowing what to do do you want to make this kind of like
game and a a discovery something fun not a video game okay but it's a game of determining does it have what it takes
to move to these highs here a way of saying it to yourself that's very disarming is okay I see how
smooth these two Highs are relatively equal that looks like a real nice price we don't see that same flatness
that so in other words if you had a shark know if you had two sharks rather you have two sharks in front of you one
removed well that would be represented something like this this is the shark with no teeth it's basically the guns
okay there's no teeth there down here there has been a shark attack how do we know that because we can see the
wounds from the teeth the jaggedness the jaggedness the jaggedness and now it's going to another fre to another frenzy
or feeding where is that well we we've just created one we have this High here that's really close to this one you see
that so you observe price action and you're looking for areas that look real where they say peace and safety sudden
them any time that you're looking at Price action and it doesn't matter what time frame you're looking at okay if
you're looking at it through the lens of a second chart Sub sub one minute or a weekly chart or a monthly chart or a
quarterly chart where it's three months of data compressed in to make the matter this principle is always true the
market will go to an area of smoothness for the purpose of disrupting any orders that would be resting above or below it
discouraged if you can't watch this stuff real time and see it or outline in advance it's okay for you to come home
work and look at your your your Parts after the fact and go back and look at this and study it as if you have
obviously the benefit of of hindsight initially but you don't want to stay in that very long so you're going to have
to prepare yourself some instruments that allow you to watch price action not replay look I am not a fan of Market
replay I absolutely loath it I hate it I can't stand it and I wish it wasn't available that's that I wish it wasn't
even available to anyone else because it's a crutch that allows frauds to be able to sound like they're smart and
teach something because it's already happened if you can do it over life action not just once in a while but
continuously and your audience or or viewership can see this then you have earned the right to have a voice and
then people should have no problemss sitting and listening to you lecture and talk about what you think's likely to
occur because you have a sound basis or Foundation to what what it is that you're talking about therefore because
you have a track of of being able to talk about before it happens it removes the anxiety that is reasonable for
everyone to have when they first sit found this but when you as the student and you don't have the ability to watch
it live because you have a job or may you're in University or you sleep like you have to sleep right
and your place in the world and your general geographic location may not be conducive for you to trade at 8:30 in
tomor New York local time you may have to trade in the London session and yes Virginia I will be up during the London
session doing one of these or two of these lectures in a week or two okay so we're not we're not focusing on one
specific time of Deb and I'll come back to that section where I'll s write down the times of De but when we looking at
initially you don't have to see this real time to get a collection of Journal but if you don't do this and
journal and screenshot and annotate your chart and study how long price runs took place how many candles did it take to
move there was there any kind of formation in the price delivery that would have caused you to not trust it
unfolding now that's going to be very hard for you to do because initially especially the men they're always going
to say no I would have never second guest it would it would have been easy for me to hold on to that and these same
people when they get into a trade if they ever were to do it in front of you they don't have any conviction and
they're going to up and bail out on the trade okay I gotta get out this I can't stand the pressure it's moved five
handles but they call 30 handles or 50 hands above or below and they get out at five hands because the pressure of it
what they expected to do and in realizing a loss in front of someone that's a lot more pressure for them and
they don't want to have that so what's more important their image or them following a model that they have seen
works and have trusted and did the back testing and they have the data behind it their image and that's not someone you
should learn from okay I'm just tossing so what we're looking for always the first thing that you're looking looking
for Caleb is where is the market smooth on the 15 the five and the one minute chart is that complicated nope it's not
complicated at all it's real simple what does it look like to be smooth well when you have price levels that create highs
here and this swing High here they're real close to one another see that when you're looking for relative
equal High here's your secret weapon for it okay how do you know it's a high probability relative equal High that's
likely to get swept or traded through how how do you know that ICT what differentiates that from any other okay
this if you have two swing highs if the one to the left is slightly higher than the right you have a very very high
probability that they're going to want there just like you see here we have a high and then the swing here happens to
be just a little bit lower than that here's what's going on this is called priming okay priming is where you
a large number of investors and they think oh it's going to go through that high but then there's a lot of folks
that don't want to see it go there because they went short so when the the market goes up here and stops and turn
turns down what that does is it creates side the shorts are relaxing if the shorts are relaxing what are they saying
they're saying that this is now what resistance so anyone that takes a new position where are they going to think
that the safest place to putli their stop loss is going to be right above highs why can we trust that they're
likely to take that relative equ High out not that will that session that you're trading but it's high probability
that this will be swept when the second or the one to the right that swing high is lower than the one to the left that
frames these two as relatively equal okay same thing is occurring here we have this High here this High here this
one being slightly lower than that one so when the market went out like this and we had this drop down what that
side what is that causing people anyone that went short here they feel like okay that's scary because it almost went
that high where their stop loss would be if they're trying to go short in this area see that so what do you think it
looks like when we have relative equal lows what would be a high probability relative equal low that the market is
likely to draw down and go below it higher low in common terms it's you refer as a failure swing okay so a
failure swing now a lot of people say oh see he's just Reinventing no see what you you're trying to trade that that's
what a failure swing is you're trying to trade you long or short on that second past that doesn't take out the low or
take out a a previous High that's selling short of fairy swing okay what I'm teaching you is is how to identify
in in price action where the algorithm will refer back to and why what are the what are the the central tenants as to
what the algorithm is referring to at a specific time of day most important and then it refers back to these because
okay it sees this High based on time and then the higher high prior to that one is here so it's very simple for the
algorithm to call that information as an array and say okay this high was at this time and this high was higher than prior
to it and they're in close proximity what's the filter I'm not going to tell you that but it's not very much in terms
of difference between the price and when you have that element the market will invariably start marching back to those
levels it does not matter matter it ABS listen listen folks it does not matter how many buyers are buying the market to
go up there and how many short sellers okay the proof of it is is just look at a depth of market look at a ladder okay
a Dom not a dome okay I'm so tired of hearing people it's not a dome do you see an e at the end of that
it's d o m it's a Dom okay depth of market look at those orders there's no imbalances there there's no
imbalances there's just as many short orders below the market as there as above but yet the market will still
march and March and March and March and go to the Beet of the drum that I tell you it does it reaches to these levels
because it's coded to do this and if you do this for a couple weeks you're going to see oh wow yeah
this this this feels artificial it feels like it's it's designed to do these type of things because they tends to repeat
every single day at specific times of the day it will do this nobody go back element every day between 8 o'clock in
the morning this is all always New York local time okay so it's very important you remember that we have new people
coming all the time and they'll say I looked at this chart here and you told me yeah but you're looking at it in
Bangladesh time okay I don't live in Bangladesh I'm in the east coast of the United States and the algorithm is on
New York local time I don't care what anybody else tells you okay that's what it's on period end the story you can
wrestle with it if you want but that's just the way it is between 8 o00 and 8:30 in the morning you want to sit down
and determine where are the smooth locations in price action on the 15 minute the five minute and the one
minute okay and we've had the 15 minute on go down to a five so right away you can see that this
High here is relative to that one and this one here also with that this one being slightly higher than that one so
there's a lot of liquidity that's 17820 75 now real important it does not mean that it has to happen during that
session it does not mean that and that is the underlying risk that you assume every single time you take a trade
you're looking for things that are going to stack the odds of probability in your favor it does not mean it's an absolute
guaranteed outcome see I have students that literally take the time and waste their time and writing me an email
sometimes they're like novels or novelas and usually it's like three paragraphs of congrat congratulating me
and and and worship and whatever and I don't like that usually when I get that kind of stuff I immedately this it's
push the email away I don't want you looking up to me I don't want you worshiping me I'm not the greatest of
all time I'm not the goat I'm not none of those things I'm just a guy that has a whole bunch of information and
experience and I want to share it with you and I want to see what you do with but these individuals will say you know
I need you to tell me how to uh make sure that I don't have this wrong I only want to take this P so how do I avoid
taking losing trades with a inversion fair value G or a mitigation BL or the breaker how do I know if it's a breaker
or if it's a shift in Market structure well that's easy uh you have to have a higher time frame premise and
the directional draw where the Market's going to go and if you think it's going to go higher um when you see the market
creating a short-term term um well I'll give you an example here we have the relative equal lows here and the
market drops you see that so this drop down here every up close candle on this frame all this right here that is your
breaker the most sensitive candle or range is going to be the last up Clos this that's this range low
and see where the body stopped right there we Wick through it I'm not denying that but the damage is always done by
the and the Range High there that is your bullish breaker but the range here from that up close candle
consecutive up closed candles all of that is technically the bullish breaker though the most sensitivity is going to
be seen in that last up close candle that is not supplying to man that's not that's not supplying to man Zone Sam
sidon would never ever ever refer to what I just said never he would never do that and he would never consider that
anyway because we're cutting through candles because we're looking at what an algorithm is doing not some Floor Trader
ticket Runners perception of something that doesn't really exist so the turn here at the bodies that tells you what
tells you the narrative so what is it going to do it's going to go higher okay so what at that time would you focus on
well you have the short-term High here the inefficiency that's traded to there we want to see it trade above it
and then act as what support which would be a what inversion OFA to do that what next this high and this inefficiency
does it do that yes what are the bodies doing stopping just that same level here and more specifically and my eyes didn't
notice this when I put it up here you separation that's a volume imbalance go back and listen to the other lectures
you have to include that volume imbalance when you have clear that got city you can see the bodies being
capsulated by that and now the market trades back up into that the body's I'm sorry the body's candlesticks are tra
inside efficiency it Wicks above it but look where the bodies are stopping and look where the bodies are over
here where's liquidity at below here nothing in here this is all very balanced price delivery because it's
back and forth every other candle is overlapping the highest high and the much kind of like coloring it very very
very good back and forth all this price actions back and forth versus then we have all these run where we have
here back down into that breaker there this response right here to what there that expectation in response in
how price can react to levels like that that's a nice little scalp right there I mean look at it moved from 55 to
what 596 that's a good run you can't get 20 handles out of that on a 15sec chart you can if you know what you're
for now also notice we've created high high lower high but real close to one another when did it
form prior to 9:30 so we have 8 to 8:30 and then you study 9 to 9:30 because it's going to do what it's going to look
and seek the liquidity or inefficiencies 930 there forming on the bullish breaker it trades down and then we have relative
here I don't like to usually do this but I have to do it to for the S of have these relative equal highs this
high and that high relative equal high and we have this area up here so if the Market's going to do what if it's going
to make a punishing move towards the shorts that want to see it drop because the market has dropped
early on 7 o'clock in the morning okay and we have all these very clean levels what did we just do here we have a low
it was traded down into it disrupted this little area in here so it's made remember I was saying earlier where the
Market's real smooth over here versus what it was doing down here where has the work been
meaning if there is a group of traders that are very cannibalistic and they tend to be more correct than wrong or if
they are the ones that generally make the money more consistently than the ones that don't in other words think of
like the world series of prer okay if you ever watched that it's really fascinating to see how the
longterm players that always find themselves at the final table they may not win but they always find their way
table that's experience and that skill well you can see those things in price action they're like fingerprints okay
you can see when the cannibals come in and they Devour the pigies they go in there and just chew them all up and it's
where the market has made Jagged price delivery always it's always like this folks it's never not going to
be hidden from you okay it's always Plain Sight but see you're so in enamored by animal patterns harmonic
patterns gimmicky named supposed retail IND indicators everybody's got a new indicator I got one for you that's going
to beat all of them if the Open high low clock how about that how about that catch me outside how about that okay
it's simple and all of you complain not all but just the ass hats there oh this convoluted so and so teaches this so
much better okay I don't see so and so doing anything I don't see so and so doing anything but using Market
replay and trying to convince himself everything he says after he says it so we had these relative equal highs
swept here see that a study bullish breaker two there so how many candles did it take to do that you screenshot it
how many how many handles did it run from the low to that relative equal High being taken out and once it does that
keep the chart active with it on there but then just make it very very light not that light make it light so that you
can still see it but have all of your focus so that way allows you to focus on the fa Gap here you trade it down into
mid gap which is this wi here since price is above it that makes it a of that trades to it we want to see it
this some of you that are trying to this are having a blast with this because not only am I you get things to
talk about in your own journal of focus but you're also seeing things unfold over a live chart and you're watching on
your live chart okay so this is not Market replay it's not delayed data okay it's not after Thea talking narrative
over a chart everything that these ass has leave comments on in my YouTube comment section you can't see what I see
and didn't used by it there's the relative equal highs there too so now same thing here you want to mute that in
terms of its importance and now you want to see does it have the wherewithal to run aggressively for that 17,8
20.75 any of this seem complicated to shouldn't I already know what you're thinking and some of you said that loud
yes because you're saying it when you talk about it it's so obvious when you talk about it when it's happening I can
see it when you point it out I just can't point it out when I'm doing right you're just learning it you expect to be
able to go out there right now if I turn this live stream off and you're just going to just know how to do it right
away because you watch them disclose one or two things in one element in the marketplace now you're suddenly going to
know how to do it nobody can reason to expect to do that you're placing too much emphasis on being fast I gotta
learn how to do it right now because the Market's going to stop working next week next year I thought the algorithm was
supposed to stop working this year whatever get out of here get out of here the batteries don't run dead on this
okay when the markets are dead then I okay but the point is this the very very first thing you're doing as an
like my son Caleb okay don't be offended by that son is what called you worse things the idea is that you're looking
for the smooth areas where the price so obviously being defended and being presented and being offered for retail
minded trades I don't look at charts I absolutely don't look at charts and think of what retail pattern here I can
use to get in sync with a price R look at that beautiful delivery right that volume balance there which is
inside and casul in that SIII went right to the high of that now when you're looking at price looking for the obvious
very very very smooth relative equal lows how do you know which one they're going to go to how do they know well I'm
sorry how do you know how can you trust how do you determine which side of the marketplace it's going to reach for
because what this is going to do it gives you the initial building blocks to oh you didn't realize we were going
there did you you didn't realize with all this jaw burning and half of you quit watching because I was talking
about things that wasn't interesting but they're coming back to the channel now or later on they'll say damn it went it
went right the where he said it was G to go it did exactly what he said it was going to do again and again and it's
going to do it tomorrow and it's going to do it Wednesday and it's going to do it Friday and it's going to do it next
week and it's going to do it every fraking week that I want to stay out here and do it live okay that's just the
here that's the way it is because I understand what this thing's doing and then you want to screenshot that okay so
when you're looking at Price action you want to be able to determine what in this whole scheme of price
delivery what does it do in terms of resonating with you where would you feel conf confident this is the part that a
lot of my students skip over they don't do any work with this part of it they ignore it they assume that it has no
bearing on them it doesn't have any basis or placement in them okay because they want some kind of gimmicky little
one two three get me in the trade where's my stop supposed to be I only want to one handle stop loss like ICT I
want to be able to do everything perfect right from step one I don't want that's not realistic because you're
going to have a whole lot of adversities and you have to invite that be comfortable with it because that's where
it's going to highlight your shortcomings and your understanding and it's going to also teach you how to
overcome it because once you identify what you're having an issue with wouldn't you want to know what your
problems are in your relationship like if you if you were married to a new new spouse and you genuinely love them but
they haven't been forthright in telling you what your character flaws are that really get under their skin because they
don't want to offend you because they don't want to hurt your feelings but wouldn't you want them
sincerely wouldn't you want them to tell you in a way that doesn't hurt you that doesn't jar you or make you feel
offended that you want to go run to the bar and cheat on them you would love for them to say hey um I love
you I sincerely sincerely care about you I I want us to be together and that romance is what you want with the
marketplace you want the market to open its arms and invite you into an Embrace and feel its bosom against
yours and that tenderness and that love that acceptance that I've always been waiting for you and you're finally with
me and I'm never going to let you go honey I'm never going to let you go see that's what you want you want that
romance but really what this is this is a dysfunctional element of family and what it does is it says listen my
husband's away come on over the bed's open and you want to go there and ROM around okay and find a spouse out of
that type of thing and you wonder why you end up with STD or a broken home that's the way it works but see you
think it's a love story it's a romance it's not it's a toxic relationship and one person in this relationship has to
be able to be reasonable and at some point the person that's reasonable has to say you know what this isn't healthy
anymore so that means I have to turn the charts off I need to stop following this Market on this time frame right now
healthy but you can't arrive at that until you do rule-based ideas and you break things down modular very
simplistic nothing I did today nothing complex I outlined every single thing go back and watch the live stream every
single thing was in advance and shown to you on a one minute chart this would be further Amplified if I was shown it to
you on a 15-second chart if you have the capabilties I'm not saying you have to but if you have the ability to look at a
15sec chart study every level I've outlined here and the logic of why it was going to draw up into that 17,8
20.75 level I gave you the bias before we really essentially started there I very Bland commentary Almost Boring
really it didn't seem scientific I used analogies that I thought were very simplistic you know when we're looking
at areas that are very smooth contrast this area up here how that was very very smooth and these
remember these levels over here show you one in addition if you weren't looking at that that's the benefit of looking at
frames because if you can frame an idea of why the Market's likely to draw to a high or low or inefficiency that is
completely visible on three time frames that means you have three time frames telling you hey pay attention to me and
if that time frame or those time frames are in agreement with a relative equal high or a inefficiency above the
marketplace that means like something here or this right here they're all that they're all Stepping Stones inside
underall sorry overall narrative that the market was going to go here when I first started the live session what
what's the first line I dropped on the chart this one it was based on these two highs here that's all it
was why did I pick this this High yes he got my question finally I've been sitting here the whole time you're
talking why' you pick that high what's the first thing I told you the algorithm is going to go based
time I don't care what Mickey Mouse pattern with Mickey Mouse logic some Romper Room theory that just got pulled
out of somebody's back side because they attention for clicks and Views and unless it stems on the basis of time
first it has to be the right time if it's not the right time of day it is absolutely not going to work period end
the story put anybody as the mentor anybody as the Traer I don't give a I tried real hard I almost got
through it I almost got through it put anybody you want in that list whatever they trade however they trade
work it will fail stick with it long enough you'll see it will fail more times than it but why and how is it that
every single time I'm sitting down with you whether it be on a Twitter space where I was calling out the candlesticks
individually before they happen or on a live stream where I'm giving you the logic explaining to you why it should do
it okay and then it just simply does it possible no ego seriously let's let's put it aside I'm not trying I'm not
trying to beat my chest here I really want you especially if you're a first time viewer here or maybe you come back
this your second time watching my live stream because you expected me to do today how is it how is it that the
market does exactly what I'm saying it's going to do you ever think about that how is it possible that one single
person can get it right so often in front of thousands of people where many of them are hoping and praying please
please God let him get it right I got to go on Twitter and brag about how you messed up today I got to make a video
exposing ICT I need grocery bill money you're so fun to manipulate all you haters but 7 o'clock is a very key
time that starts what the morning session it matters not that we're trading Forex or Futures the morning
session am session starts at 7 o'clock in the morning near time okay so you can says I can't be in front of the charts
between 8:00 and 8:30 and maybe you can't even trade the 9:30 opening bell for indices because you have to get
ready for work okay but it just so happens that the time elements in your personal life and geographic location in
the world that it allows you and aord you to look at the Mark between 7:00 and 7:45 worst case scenario 7:30 if you're
going to work with smaller time frames you absolutely can use 7 o' to 7:30 as a model to do this very
thing so your key times are this 7 o'clock in the morning to 7:30 in that 30-minute window you're
going to look for relative equal highs that have happened prior to 7 o' okay and you're going to be looking through
the time frames of the one minute chart the five minute chart and the 15 minute time now Caleb you're not expected to do
anything else beyond that until I change the depth of what your focus should be right now you're just having three
up since the 15minute time frame is pretty pretty static you only need to refer to it once in the morning and then
your second chart could be the five minute chart that's what it but then what you're doing is is you're
watching between 7 o'clock and 7:30 or 8:00 to 8:30 or 9 to 9:30 opening belt you're looking for where is the market
think about that remember being a kid walking when you see a pond it's real smooth wow look at that was like a
mirror you can see the sky's reflection off of it so smooth what's the first thing you jumped in your head I need a
rock for what because you can't accept that our sinful nature says we have to disrupt that so you pick up a rock and
you want throw it out there why what's it going to do it's going to cause ripples that's exactly why a weak
character individual in a relationship ship something smooth ain't no Ruckus and what they got to do they go
out there and you chase some th go to the bar and pick up some Floy or some silver tonged box it says
all the right things for her and you invite that destruction well that's what the market does folks it's a
dysfunctional family environment and you have be the one that says not today Satan not today not today I know your
tricks I know your snares I know how you're going to do it okay so what's the market going to do every single
session in the morning you have three opportunities and you don't have to trade in the afternoon you don't have to
trade the London session you have three opportunities in the morning to set the stage for a run that will build if you
don't have any understanding about bias okay if you don't know what direction the Market's going to move
in when I go into other people's live streams and I say note this note that here's the secret I just gave to you
what I do every single time I go into uh tja traes when Patrick will had balls and let me into his live streams and
chat he won't do that now because he's gonna be pay me $500,000 this year um the whole business of anyone else I
talked to trades by mat for a mon told him what I was going to do what I was looking for in private text and he can
show I gave him permission he can show you what I was expecting and he watched me do this for almost a
month and I got two or three of them wrong but most of them were like and guess what I was doing folks but I just
hugard not as much as I shared with ch my that but in certain instances I shared him this is what I'm looking for
level so it's not like I'm not afraid to share this I I've put what I think is going to happen in the witness of other
people and they can come out and say yeah this guy don't know some's talking and they're not telling me that
I'm invited them prove the world that I that I like certain people in this inders and the ones I like I converse
with I share and I engage with and when I go into other people's live streams and I'm helping promote them uh
sometimes I'll go out and I'll point to something and I'll say watch this level when I was on Twitter watch not this
level I was doing this and my private mentorship never learned this I never sat down with them never told him that
this is a secret weapon it's a it's a bazooka when a BB gun's necessary when all you need is a match
this is a flamethrower it's it's it's the thing that makes every playing field even they cannot hide it
from you they cannot hide it from you you're never not going to be able to see it it's always there and in plain terms
it's this if you can contrast one side marketplace against another let me let me do this in this little area down here
okay in a small little open section I'm going to say this I'm going to close it somewh be with my wife and
haven't if you take this a moment for now if you learn something today and if you didn't learn something you're a
fraking liar okay but if you honestly was with me this entire session and you watch me outline this and I told you why
it was going to go here what levels were on and you watch it pan and you understood and you understand now and if
you don't I'm going to make it clear for you give it a thumbs up because I that as I appreciate you spending time with
us on C I don't need to be doing this I can do this privately with Caleb I don't I I can tell Caleb I understand that you
want to make a YouTube channel I understand that that could make you a little bit of scratch and money I
understand that but no I don't want these people to know this I could do that and I don't feel bad telling you
that openly because I've done a lot of that stuff that I don't want to share certain things because it's too good
because 20-year-old kids go out there and pretend they didn't learn it from me and they found it on their own and they
relabel it so they can make a name for themselves and then eventually people find out about them and then they expose
them D you're nothing more than just an ripoff and you can spare yourself of all that stuff just by being honest and say
you know what thank you ICT for sharing this I'm going to make it mine and this is how I use it I got no I got no
problem with that I got students out there that doing mentorships now okay it's their business it's not mine
they're not hiding where they learn it from and that that's all I've asked for this is just remember who fed you that's
it I'm not doing paid mentorships I could be out here teaching this kind of stuff and more for millions of dollars a
month all over again folks I don't want it and if it wasn't for my son tapping me saying hey Dad give me another chance
of do this I want to learn it I wouldn't be doing this have you been seeing any videos no I'm not worried about it but
since he wants to I'm going to pour myself into it I'm going to pour everything I have into this and I'm not
fully back to myself I'm not doing well like I I've been experiencing vertigo I've had ey blood pressure I've had
chest pains I've rushed to their Hospital like I had a lot of stuff going on and I'm not stressed about nothing
it's just my body's going through something and I don't know what it is and I don't not know how to trade I know
exactly how to trade I know exactly what these markets going to do any given day even on Sloppy Seek and Destroy days in
fact I'm going to wait until we have one and I'm going to show you me executing in one of them I am not fearful of any
of these Mar profiles I'm not fearful of my stuff falling out of style because there is no style this is the market
this is the source code but when you set up a framework of whatever you're going to study in the morning if you're going
to trade the morning session your key times you have to absolutely be in front of the charts between 7 o'clock and 7:30
in the morning always New York local time okay if you can be in front of the charts by 7 o'clock this is what you're
doing but if you can't you do the same thing at 8:00 to 8:30 the same thing at okay this is your pre-market range write
that down because if you don't write it down you're going to forget you're going to call it the opening range it's not
the opening range the opening range is the first 30 minutes after the opening BT at the New York session the first 30
after 7 o'clock to 7:30 that is your pre-market range 7:30 to 8 o' is your range remember I was telling I could
trade every single hourly candle now you're starting to think your are they it's fun isn't it and obviously the
9 to 9:30 that's your pre-market range and then post 9:30 to 10 o'clock that's your opening range there is no 15 minute
opening range I don't care what anybody tells you okay it's a 30 minute opening algorithmic okay so what you're doing
and this this little range here that's being shown here with this rectangle what I'm saying is this is essentially
that 30 minute interval whether it be 7:00 to 7:30 or 8:00 to 8:30 or 9 to 9:30 that pre-market range in that range
what you're doing is you're looking at this this line or beginning of that shaded area would delineate the 7
o'clock or the 8 o'cl or the 9 o'cl where it begins at that specific top of the outle and then this would be
the range that makes up that first 30 minutes now it's not obviously the scale but I'm oversimplifying for the of
saying prior to that range anything before or to the left of this you're highs or equal lows which side has
it because that's your bias it's going to draw to that how do you know if you both because I heard you you're thinking
but what happens if you have a relative equal High here and relative equal low you wait for the first one to get
disrupted because once that happens then you work to the other one that's that's your bias so you have to defer and wait
now gamblers or live streamers that just want to have people watching and doing anything and not really executing on
stream but after the trade starts moving in their favor then they'll show to trade here what good is that what good
is that that just proves you're not confident in what you're doing and you're going to show it after it's moved
in your favor talk about it explain it and then do it I'm going to do that but today I gave you a clinic on how to
determine bias how it's easy for me and it's easy for you whichever one has the relative equal highs or relative equal
lows that's a smooth area it will be disrupted anywhere where you see Jagged edges like this down here see I went
Jagged and then ripped higher what's it telling you what's it telling you I'm going to look for buy side liquidity buy
stops this has been a trap they engage traders to go short they're they're trapped short on a breakout
or they're not trying to take the shorts out of the market yet and that's why you see all this in here creeping up this is
all balanced that's why this Spike stop right top of the breaker isn't that interesting isn't that interesting I've
nonstop no chance for me to have another add over voice over it's all live you watched me do it live I explained the
logic and now here's the wonderful thing privilege to go back to your charts and back test this and your jaws going to
drop you're going to be thinking it's always been there but I've been looking for this stupid ass harmonic pattern
I've been waiting for my yin and yang to appear in my chart I've been waiting for my moving average is crossing over but
my my Lux algo indicator said this and then said that and I got tripped up I thought it was going to do no
about what I said in any of the mentorship the years they're just very deep dry lessons that give you the why
because I'm a person that's highly technical I want to know why it's going to do it don't tell me something and
then do it 10 times and we write 10 times and that's not going to convince me of anything I need to know why it's
doing it and if you don't think critically about that you're a gambler you absolutely are a gambler I
need to understand before I put money behind it I need to know why is this Market going to do this then at that
time why should it behave that way and folks you can't get any pler or simpler than simply saying okay where it's
smooth now you're going to say well this isn't new ICT you talked about relative equal highs and lows before right and I
taught that you should be aiming for them but you haven't been trading like that you've been doing other stuff and
then cussing me behind my back saying this stuff doesn't work this guy's a fraud we don't see his name on the
fraud I'm out here in front of your life telling you what's going to happen you think I can't do that in Rob's
C you think I can't do that come on you guys are Gable man you're so easy you're so easy I love it
it but anyway Market trades down to the bullish breaker that I absolutely identified before it hits it and then
goes to the relative equal highs I told you to focus on and then I gave you this one here and I told you this inbalance
it's prior to these relative equal highs being taken but this was where we were focused on and look where we're
closing I really do have to close in this price run and we're not going to use all of this this is
excited if we have this segment of price here okay more specifically let's be honest because this is the one I drew
your attention to first so we'll stick with that even though that that other one wasat even before it got
Traer did you get the video a thumbs up by the way did you take a take a second of your time to press that up thumb icon
on YouTube that's free I didn't charge anything for it because that really is a way for you to communicate to me that
you had fun today that you really did leave and learn something and now you have something that's tangible that you
go back and look at every single day in the past in journal because you should be doing that every single day you break
down the at 7 o' in the morning have 7 o'clock in the morning all the way till say uh 11:00 okay so it's four hours and
you want to have your 15 minute time frame your five minute time frame your one minute time frame charts and
annotate it may require you to have multiple charts from that individual one minute chart where you're zoomed in and
you're Ting something specific that are very Salient to you because most of you may not have trusted this as a bullish
breaker when you saw this drop in here you're hoping and some of you were puffing and thinking he's getting
screwed in in front of all this I love it I love it I love it you're drooling and then what happens it rips your face
again I know I know I could have a whole lot of fun with that but I'm not because I'm here to try to teach my son and
learn if you go back through all this price run here okay what you're going to do is you're going to focus on the
points that make the most obvious that you could see and it says you know what I understand this even though ICT
pointed out this breaker you may have noticed it maybe you didn't if you didn't that's not your PD
R if you noticed that it traded down into this sphere Val you got right there inside of this old Cy which is
midpoint between where we expect price to trade to which is above these highs and where it traded from
see that so if we see where it's likely to go and where it went from where it originated from where's the midpoint
well let's do a simple measurement here's your fib and we're going to say something above these relative equal
highs we'll just randomly pick an area right there okay I'm just being very Bland there's no real reason I'm picking
that price it's just simply slightly above the relative equal High there's no other logic simply that okay so I'm not
trying to complicate anything but if you take that and you go down to the lows that are relatively equal not the lowest
low that's the manipulation you want to use the relative equal lows like that okay see that and then you have
essentially the midpoint here in close proximity to that you have this fair Gap and you have a sp and this one here
can be used even though it's a little bit above equilibrium because we didn't take this high and that high out which I
was outlining to you real time take that out yet we didn't take out these two relative equal highs when it was traded
down to the breaker but what happens when it trades up here and then at real time I said watch this fair value got
stream go back and watch the stream when we were trading right there I said watch and here we are trading got here and
then takes off and runs to where we were deliver the smooth areas are going to be attacked the sharks are going to go to
Water that's where they're going to go why because as soon as someone in there starts shaking in fear that their Stop's
going to be taken that still water will Ripple and that triggers a frenzy and the sharks are going to go right
there you don't trade into levels where the sharks have already had a frenzy and here okay they've already done the work
there's been an attack down here how do you know there's been the great disturbance in in in what price was
doing and how it was delivered it's Jagged like shark teeth cutting through the side of a whale's body it's been
delivered you can see it it's physically representative in the jaggedness of the swings going down where we don't see
that jaggedness up here it's nice and Smo thrilling biting it's safe put your stops above you like a siren calling out
to the sailors come to me come to me and Rocks I know Mr anology I don't know from but you have to go through all of
this price action in here and determine what price level makes sense to you with do you see the fair value gaps
where I was outlining before I did it did it make sense when I was drawing out did you change your expectation and
get fearful that I'm wrong and it's not going to go up there because that this drop here what's occurring here the only
thing it's doing is at 9:30 during the opening range it's doing what it's swim something that's opposite to the
real move the real move was given to you with these highs it's going to go there at any time did you hear me sound
nervous in front of all of you I don't know how many people were watching I think there was like 6,000 earlier first
time I checked the streams continuity but I haven't seen I don't know what the highest high do in terms
of how many people are watching did that sound like I was nervous because I don't think I was nervous at all way and I've
been really really trying not to say any on the curse words and stuff but sometimes it's just it has it find its
way out I'm I'm human I'm a sinner and I have to repent all the time when I do it um I always regret when it slips out but
that's I'm I'm real like I'm a real person and I have character flaws like anybody else but I try very very hard
today not to use that type of language but depending upon what subject matter I refer to it will it'll draw it at me and
I'm not proud of it but anyway we can see how that c becomes an inversion Fair Val G here and then it sends price
higher reches down and then you have your second leg redistribution and it the smooth area thats up this
Market I knew it I yeah that's how it is so when you're looking for the bias okay the easiest most scientific
proven nine out of 10 doctors approved ICT has nailed it down to a science of wherever the smooth equal Highs are or
smooth relative equal lows are at the beginning of 7 o' to 7:30 or 8:00 to 8:30 or 9 to 9:30 you got three
okay as each one of these time Windows by so at 7 o'clock we formed the relative equal high and then at 8 to
8:30 we didn't go up there yet so that means that what 9 to 9:30 chances are Run see how that does that it increases
the likelihood of it going there it doesn't diminish it because it's building up more trust in that are right
there so the framework begins at 7 o' in morning start looking for relative equal before key key takeaway is not before 7
o'clock at 7 o'clock look for them to form big big big big takeaway there okay if you're looking for relative equal
highs PRI 7 o'clock in the morning you may you may get it but many times you're expecting the London session to be
completely overd and it's it's most times not the case so it kind of like builds in this filter where you're not
trying to demand that the run on London or dismissed because of price over overlapping it and going back over top
of it because the general consensus is we could see the higher low they form in m so if it's bearish or bullish relative
to a higher time frame draw which is not necessary notice I haven't even used that here yet only thing I used was a
15minute time frame a 5 minute time frame in a one minute time frame and I was framing on the basis of time because
I understand my algorithm I understand what it's going to do I understand exactly what these markets are going to
do every single day every single day it will not stop it will not be hidden from you but it can be disrupted by manual
intervention and that always cause me to lose it will always cause me to be incorrect because that's something that
we and no one can predict it's their Casino if they want to come in and you know disrupt everything it is what it is
and that's the inherent risk that every one of us has to assume while trading so that's that should be the number one
reason why you should never over leverage because that is always looming and condition in the marketplace right
now in geopolitical tension and turmoil that is expected to unfold at any given time any moment folks things could pop
off and your little indicator or your little market structure idea whether it be mine or somebody else's stuff means
nothing when that happens it literally is Canon fodder it's gone you're dusted and if you happen to be
overleveraged when it happens you're and sorry but it's not going to be pleasurable it's going to be it's going
to be a hard swallow and probably end you and take you out the game entirely and all of that is avoidable if you
don't over leverage if you trade with one contract and you try to capture moves like this I promise you're going
to beat the socks off of every one of the live streamers out there and my students included all of them that are
doing well now they're going to start applying this and watch and see how well increasing and people that don't
their trades are going to start working and go back and look at what I'm taught you here they're going you're going to
see that they're using this too it's a secret weapon I didn't want to give it to anybody I did not want to give it
anyone it's a it's a home field advantage one of many that I have but because I want my son to know what he's
doing that's real simple it's it's not complicated it's one or the other and if there's two extremes above and below the
that's relative equal high and relative equal low then you just wait for one of them to be disrupted and just sometimes
you'll miss a move sometimes it'll do it and then you won't get a trade who cares who cares when you back test this you're
you're GNA see like what am I worried about man like this is so many times offered to me every single week right
that's the mindset you need to come away with not I got to trade every single day when it's so obvious when it's so
that's the ones you want to trade on because retail is going to have every hope and prayer hanging on those
relative equal highs thinking it's resistance and they're going to eat them they're going to devour them and
grind their bones the powder and you can have a moral dilemma and have some convictions about that being oh I can't
do that to somebody else I can because they signed the same risk disclosure that I do when I open
to and if they make the wrong move eat that's how you eat here and if you have a problem with that
you and there's nothing wrong with that either but hopefully you you see that when we're doing this we're not trying
to be smart we're not trying to be more popular than somebody else we're not trying to get more attention and more
viewership or more followers we're in here to try to make money so that way you can make your ends me that's it and
some of you will supercharge that and become pillars in the community and and and Titans and be so much bigger than I
am and I'm here to see it I want to see it I want to cheer you on I'd love it for one of my sons to be
person I've been trying to cultivate that since they were little but they're they're individual personalities and you
know how it is you listen to your parents and even if your dad can do it and prove it over and over and over and
over and over again sometimes still isn't enough as a motivation to do because you have to want to do it and
guess what makes that happen when you make them work menial jobs and they hate it what's the alternative College that's
question so do what works do what works and can be proven I could do this in front of the Supreme Court
right just like I did today I ain't afraid of it I'm not afraid of this and when you get that confidence it's not
arrogance but when somebody doesn't know how to do something and they feel miserably when they hear somebody talk
like that and when they see somebody display it it's so uncomfortable it's unbearable for them so now you are a
narcissistic jerk you're arrogant you're okay is that going to make me lose money on the next trade no is that going to
make me forget that the logic that is being employed here no I'm not here for friends I'm not here for friends neither
be I'm warming up to these candlesticks when it's appropriate but when the date is over I'm going home alone they're not
and I'm leaving before any kids are made simple as that I'm staying protected I'm wrapping up I got a stop
loss I know when I hit the brakes and go out the other direction if it's a grenade I'm getting out of there before
damage and that's me thinking like a man for the ladies you you come up with your own analogy I'm not that good with
side but hopefully you you've learned something today um I'm going to close this one I going invite you all tomorrow
to to come back if you found this insightful it'll be a little bit more technical tomorrow uh today was more or
less the mindset how to relax when you're watching the charts and what to look for so that way you're not holding
so much expectation over yourself and then you can enjoy enjoy studying it because it's important that you do enjoy
it because if it's if it's daunting and you're not really seeing any kind of fun um char istics in it it's going to be
very hard to stick with it so I I tried to cultivate that today if I was successful you can obviously show me by
giving a thumbs up I promise you I don't make any more money I thumbs up and you don't take any money from me when you
put the thumbs down either it doesn't change anything but it's just a way for you to give me feedback that that you
found something in this today that made sense for you that you are inspired to go into your charts and you had fun
while you were running so this is going to be the end of lecture number one dealing with the foundations of
determining a bias it's very very simple it doesn't doesn't require a whole lot of complicated things it's very time
specific without the time elements none of it matters and it's very very rule based that doesn't require a whole lot
of moving Parts where it's smooth it's going where it's Jagged it's going to move away from very very simple logic
folks not complicated at all and I'll talk to you tomorrow Lord willing be
